## About Me:
I am 23 years old, I work as an engineer. Being in the army, I had a lot of time to think about how to live in this world, in which direction to develop, where it is better to try myself, whether I like what I do. And I came to the conclusion that I want to try myself in the IT field, in which I can study, develop, work, communicate with new interesting people. Despite the fact that this is one of the most demanded areas in the world. That is why I decided to try myself here. My goal is to develop in this direction, gain knowledge in the field of front-end development and, of course, get my first job.
